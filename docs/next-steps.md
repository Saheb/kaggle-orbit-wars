# Next steps / idea backlog

Living doc — efforts and ideas, roughly prioritized. Discipline: **one delta per cloud run.**
Status tags: 🔵 in-flight · 🟢 ready-to-build · 🟡 idea · ✅ done · ⏸ parked.
Current focus: **Phase 2 — reinforcement** (docs/phase2.md). VDN/per-slot concluded (doesn't work; back to standard arch).

## No live instance (2026-06-10)

- **rev58b flooded (~330k) → killed; GCP `orbit-wars-training` (asia-south1-b) DELETED.** Final flood
  log preserved at `gpu_run_artifacts/rev58/logs/train_gpu_phase1_rev58b_20260610_170044.log`.
- Phase 2 pivoted to the **Tier-1 outcome-tied design** (forward-staging mask + drop `defense_coef`
  + small aggressive pool). Keystone built + unit-tested. See `docs/phase2.md` (top Update) and §0 below.

## 0. In-flight — Phase 2 reinforcement, Tier-1 (docs/phase2.md)

**rev58/58b resume probes both flooded — cost knob dead, root cause re-diagnosed.** rev58 (cost 0)
and rev58b (cost 0.001) both *drifted* from a healthy gated start into a flood (~330–400k: reinf
0.69–0.75, `p90` 357–408, `Vμ`→negative). Drift-from-healthy ⇒ a property of the reward **objective**
(recurs from scratch), and the pump is **`defense_coef` itself**: in a symmetric self-play mirror,
hold-everything-via-reinforce dominates risky attacking, so the term meant to *incentivise*
reinforcement *is* the flood. Full write-up: `docs/phase2.md` top Update.

**Tier-1 design (locked 2026-06-10) — "outcome-tied attribution":**
- 🟢 **Forward-staging mask (BUILT + unit-tested):** own reinforce target legal only if closer to the
  nearest enemy than the source (`--reinforce-forward-only`) → rear hoard impossible by construction.
  `torch_env.py` + `tests/test_reinforce_mask.py`.
- 🟢 **Drop `defense_coef`** — reinforcement gets no shaping reward; credited purely via terminal +
  early_capture through GAE. Drop `reinforce_cost` (dead). Keep gate(3), garrison-floor(10),
  expansion 0.03, speed 0.3, early_capture anneal, fire-entropy 0.005.
- 🟢 **Small aggressive pool (rev53b-proven)** — held-out LB archetypes so hoarding *loses games*
  (the asymmetry that makes reinforcement instrumentally valuable; a pure mirror gives flood OR
  passivity). (c)-attribution removes the bad incentive; the pool supplies the attack pressure — both needed.
- 🟢 **p2rev1 READY** (fresh Phase-2 numbering, not the rev5x lineage): snowball-BC warmstart
  (`bc_snowball_pairwise15.pt`, aggressive winners, 53% reinforce coverage) + forward mask + drop
  defense + pool (lb1152 hammer + debatreya_1300 @0.25). Target-head diagnostics (`H_tgt`, target
  own/neutral/enemy share) added. Script: `gpu_run_artifacts/p2rev1/`. Awaiting launch.

Selection stays PURE: win-rate/Elo vs the held-out ladder decides; `reinforce_rate`/game-length are
diagnostics. Tier-2 (full causal fleet attribution) held in reserve if Tier-1 underperforms.

## 1. Phase 2 fallbacks / follow-ups (conditional on rev58b)

- 🟢 **From-scratch (BC warmstart) run** — only if we conclude the *base* matters after all (unlikely per the drift
  finding). BC seed options analyzed: Isaiah (controlled) vs Jake/aggressive-cohort (snowball, full 0→0.61 reinforce
  ramp). Snowball selector to pull aggressive replays without player names: high `avg_score` + `size_bytes`<3.5MB.
- 🟢 **Eval/export gate parity** — `action_mask.py` has NO empire gate; before submitting a Phase-2 checkpoint, add the
  gate there so inference matches training (else the policy could reinforce <3 planets at inference). Do at export time.
- 🟡 **Reinforce-aware BC warmstart from top-player replays** (180 games in `/tmp/fresh_validate`, 89 snowball in
  `/tmp/snowball`; analyzer `orbit_wars_rl/fetch_analyze_top_replays.py`, timing-corrected).

## 2. Diversity / anti-cycling (still the structural lever, independent of Phase 2)

- 🟢 **Pool curation** — fold cross-run best selves as fast `self` members; keep self-pool small (8–12 diverse) so PFSP
  gets ≥30 games/opponent. `--preseed-pool`.
- 🟢 **Distill Ajay → fast neural clone (DAgger)** — adds the selective-targeting style we lack; orbit_lite can't be
  GPU-batched. Spec: `docs/ajay_distillation_spec.md`; tool to build: `dagger_collect.py`.
- 🟡 **Neural exploiters / mini-league** — principled anti-cycling; all-neural avoids the slow-opponent problem. Endgame.
- ✅ **Cross-checkpoint eval panel** (`gpu_run_artifacts/cross_eval/run_cross_eval.sh`) — use every ~1M during training.

## 3. Hyperparameter / dynamics probes

- 🟡 **gamma 0.999** (not 1.0) — longer horizon propagates the win signal earlier → less shaping dependence.
- 🟡 **rollout 32 + ppo_epochs 1** — top-LB suggestion: short rollout = local credit; ppo_epochs 1 = more on-policy.

## 4. Measurement / instrumentation

- 🟢 **Always-on held-out ladder during training** — eval vs a fixed diverse set every ~1M; self-play WR + `Vμ`/EV are
  blind to absolute regression. Selection is PURE: win-rate decides, not shaped reward / `Vμ` / Ajay panel alone.

## 5. Parked

- ⏸ **FFA / 4p** — above par on wins, no validated lever, no faithful local eval. Don't spend GPU. (`project_ffa_not_the_gap`)
- ⏸ **VDN / per-slot credit** — concluded: per-slot ship-credit → undercommitment / collapse. Back to joint-credit standard arch.

## 6. Ops / tech debt

- 🟢 **Bake auto-terminate-on-completion into launch scripts** (GCP `--terminate-on-done` not wired; manual delete required).
- 🟡 **Run scripts + seed_checkpoints are rsync-EXCLUDED** by `launch_gpu_gcp.sh` → must scp them after launch (caught us on rev58).
- 🟡 **Pool-opponent `state_dict` reload** fires ~123×/iter — rollout-throughput inefficiency; optimize only if SPS bottlenecks.
